# Documentation

The documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=18.0)

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
